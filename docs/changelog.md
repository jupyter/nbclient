# Changelog

## 0.3.0

### Major Changes

- The `(async_)start_new_kernel_client` method now supports starting a new client when its kernel manager (`self.km`) is a `MultiKernelManager`. The method now returns the kernel id in addition to the kernel client. If the kernel manager was a `KernelManager`, the returned kernel id is `None`. [#51](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/pull/51)
- Added sphinx-book-theme for documentation. Added a CircleCI job to let us preview the built documentation in a PR. [#50](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/pull/50)
- Added `reset_kc` option to `reset_execution_trackers`, so that the kernel client can be reset and a new one created in calls to `(async_)execute` [#44](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/pull/44)

### Docs

- Fixed documentation [#46](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/pull/46) [#47](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/pull/47)
- Added documentation status badge to the README
- Removed conda from documentation build
